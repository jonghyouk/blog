<p>Something about me.</p>

<p>I am Jong-Hyouk Lee. I love my wife who has a childlike innocence and my two little sons - Jangwoo and Hyunwoo, so I have got to take care of my family in all my life, but I have not yet been firm on my legs. I received my B.S. degree in Information System Engineering from Daejeon University in 2004 and carried the M.S. and Ph.D. work in Computer Engineering under Prof. Tai-Myoung Chung at Sungkyunkwan University, Korea (M.S., 2007; Ph.D., 2010). In 2009, I joined the project team IMARA at INRIA, where I undertook the protocol design and implementation for IPv6 vehicular (ITS) communication and security. I started my academic profession at the Network, Security, and Multimedia (RSM) Department of TELECOM Bretagne, France in 2012 as an Assistant Professor. In September 2013, I moved to Sangmyung University, Korea. In March 2020, I joined the <a href="http://home.sejong.ac.kr/~isdpt/">Department of Computer and Information Security</a>, <a href="http://eng.sejong.ac.kr/index.do">Sejong University</a> as an Associate Professor. I’m involved in standardization activities at the ISO TC204 WG16, ETSI TC ITS, and IETF. I twice received Excellent Research Awards from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Korea. I won the Best Paper Award at the <em>IEEE WiMob 2012</em> and received the 2015 Best Land Transportation Paper Award from the <em>IEEE Vehicular Technology Society</em>. In November 2014, I was selected as the Young Researcher of the Month by the <em>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</em>. I received the Haedong Young Scholar Award from <em>Haedong Science and Culture Foundation</em> in 2017, and IEEE Systems Journal Best Paper Award from <em>IEEE Systems Council</em> in 2018. I was a tutorial speaker at the <em>IEEE WCNC 2013</em> and <em>IEEE VTC 2014 Spring</em>. I’m a general chair of <em>Qshine 2016</em> and technical program chair of the <em>IEEE ICCE 2017</em> and <em>IEEE ICCE 2018</em>. I’m a senior member of the IEEE. I’m an associate editor for <a href="https://cesoc.ieee.org/publications/ieee-transactions-on-consumer-electronics.html">IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics</a> and <a href="https://cesoc.ieee.org/publications/ce-magazine.html">IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine</a>. I’m an author of the following Internet Standards: IETF RFC 8127, 8191, and 8691. Research interests include protocol engineering, malware analysis, and blockchain.</p>

<p>I’m leading the <a href="pel.sejong.ac.kr">Protocol Engineering Lab.</a> in <a href="http://eng.sejong.ac.kr/index.do">Sejong University</a></p>
