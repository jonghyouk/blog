After six and a half years, I again changed my working place from Sangmyung University to Sejong University located in Seoul. Note that I had joined the Department of Software, Sangmyung Universtiy after several years of working experiences in France. There was no other reason why I changed my affiliation. People in the department of my previous university were all good and working conditions were also good for me, but only I wanted to more focuse on research, especially security research. 

Here in the Department of Department of Computer and Information Security, Sejong University, I'm starting again with my four master students who worked with me from my previous university. The lab's name is the same: Protocol Engineering Lab. We keep the name as we're working on security from the perspective of protocol engineering. 

Keep going! ;)
